# STEMinists
An online web application for connecting women mentors and mentees in STEM.
Created as part of the SHEHACKS+VI 2022 hackathon
# Inspiration
As women in STEM, all of us are abundantly aware that we are in the minority. We developed this project in an attempt to encourage other young women who may be interested in pursuing a career in STEM. We decided to take inspiration from ADPList which is a website for connecting mentors and mentees. Our web application targets a smaller consumer group; specifically, women in or interested in STEM. The ultimate goal of the project is to setup a community of women who share similar interests and experiences in order to expand the support systems for women in STEM.
# What it does
STEMinists is an online web application for connecting female mentors and mentees in to encourage more female participation in STEM fields and to help bridge the gap for the inexperienced. A form is used to sign up to be a member. The web application is backed by an algorithm that matches mentors and mentees together based on their common interests.
